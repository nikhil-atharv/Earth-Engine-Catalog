    "description": "WeatherNext Graph is an experimental dataset of global medium-range weather\nforecasts produced by Google DeepMind's graphical neural network weather\nmodel.\n\nThe dataset includes real-time and historical forecasts. This includes major\natmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind, precipitation,\nhumidity, geopotential, vertical velocity and pressure. The spatial\nresolution is 0.25 degrees and temporal resolution is 6 hours.\nInitialisation times are 00z, 06z, 12z, 18z. The data are 6 hour forecasts\nup to a max lead time of 10 days.\n\nThis dataset is not public. To access this data, please fill out this\n[request form](https://forms.gle/q8GATt5yr3rLJNrw5).\n\nMore information on the model is in \"[Learning skillful\nmedium-range global weather forecasting](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1550/full)\"\n",
