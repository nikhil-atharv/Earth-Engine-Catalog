    "description": "WeatherNext Graph is an experimental dataset of global medium-range weather\nforecasts produced by Google DeepMind's [graphical neural network weather\nmodel](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1550/full).\n\nThe experimental dataset includes real-time (i.e., any data that relates to\na time that is no more than 48 hours in the past (\"Real-Time Experimental\nData\")) and historical (i.e. any data that relates to a time that is more\nthan 48 hours ago (\"Historic Experimental Data\")) forecasts. This includes\nmajor atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind,\nprecipitation, humidity, geopotential, vertical velocity, and pressure.\nThe spatial resolution is 0.25 degrees and temporal resolution is 6 hours.\nInitialisation times are 00z, 06z, 12z, 18z. The data are 6 hour forecasts\nup to a max lead time of 10 days.\n\nIf you are interested in accessing the experimental dataset, please fill\nout this [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform).\n\nMore information on the model is in \"[Learning skillful\nmedium-range global weather forecasting](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1550/full)\"\n\nIf you have any questions on using this experimental dataset, or would\nlike to use it for purposes not currently permitted under the terms of use\nset out below, please contact weathernext@google.com.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe experimental data was generated by models which communicate with and/or\nreference the following separate libraries and packages:\n* Data and products of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), as modified by Google.\n* Modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information 2023.
