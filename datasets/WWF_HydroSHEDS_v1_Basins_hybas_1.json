    "description": "HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic\ninformation for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent\nformat. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and\nraster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed\nboundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS\nis based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar\nTopography Mission (SRTM).\n\nThis dataset provides polygons of nested, hierarchical watersheds, based on\n15 arc-seconds (approx. 500 m at the equator) resolution raster data.\nThe watersheds range from level 1 (coarse) to level 12 (detailed), using Pfastetter codes.\n\nTechnical documentation:\n\n[https://hydrosheds.org/images/inpages/HydroBASINS_TechDoc_v1c.pdf](https://hydrosheds.org/images/inpages/HydroBASINS_TechDoc_v1c.pdf)\n\nNote that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above\n60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available\nand thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).\n\nHydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\nConservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological\nSurvey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The\nNature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research\nof the University of Kassel, Germany.\n",
