    "description": "The AVHRR Pathfinder Version 5.3 Sea Surface Temperature dataset (PFV53)\nis a collection of global, twice-daily 4km sea surface temperature data\nproduced in a partnership by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center\nand the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric\nScience. PFV53 was computed from data from the AVHRR instruments\non board NOAA's polar orbiting satellite series using an entirely\nmodernized system based on SeaDAS. PFV53 data are nearly 100%\ncompliant with the GHRSST Data Specification Version 2.0 for L3C\nproducts and only deviate from that standard in that 'sses_bias',\n'sses_standard_deviation', and 'sst_dtime' variables are empty and hence\nnot included into EE assets. PFV53 data were collected through the\noperational periods of the NOAA-7 through NOAA-19 Polar Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (POES), and are available from 1981 to 2014.\nAdditional information is available at the\n[NOAA Pathfinder site](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/satellitedata/pathfinder4km53/).\n\nAdditional band details can be found in the\n[Tech Specs](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/sds/cdr/CDRs/Sea_Surface_Temperature_Pathfinder/AlgorithmDescription_01B-08.pdf)\npage.\n\nThese data were provided by GHRSST and the US NOAA National\nCenters for Environmental Information (NCEI). This project was\nsupported in part by a grant from the NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR)\nProgram for satellites.\n",
