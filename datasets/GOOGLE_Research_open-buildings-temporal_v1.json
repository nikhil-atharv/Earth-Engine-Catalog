    "description": "The Open Buildings 2.5D Temporal Dataset contains data about building\npresence, fractional building counts, and building heights at an effective<sup>1</sup>\nspatial resolution of 4m (rasters are provided at 0.5m resolution) at an\nannual cadence from 2016-2023. It is produced from open-source,\nlow-resolution imagery from the [Sentinel-2](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2)\ncollection.\n\nThe dataset is available across Africa, South Asia, South-East Asia, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean. The goal of this data is to support organizations\n(e.g., governmental, non-profits, commercial) focusing on a range of\napplications for social good.\n\nExplore the data interactively with the demo Earth Engine [app](https://goo.gle/open-buildings-temporal-demo-app). (In case you encounter performance issues with the Earth Engine app please try [this](https://goo.gle/open-buildings-temporal-demo) Earth Engine script instead.)\n\nAlternatively, if you are not an Earth Engine user, you can download the\ndata directly from Google Cloud Storage using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/building_detection/open_buildings_temporal_download_region_geotiffs.ipynb).\n\nFor more details on the project and FAQs about the data checkout the project\n[website](https://sites.research.google/gr/open-buildings/temporal/).\n\nExample scripts:\n\n* <code>[How to compute building count for a given AOI](https://code.earthengine.google.com/31ca8ccee65887ed2a152c8ea920bbd2)</code>\n* <code>[How to compute built-up area for a given AOI](https://code.earthengine.google.com/46468628f66eb57c79753ae4c1c09f54)</code>\n* <code>[How to see two years side-by-side and compare](https://code.earthengine.google.com/e9e5a84d279d4b5669872a560e8329a2?hideCode=true)</code>\n\n<small><sup>1</sup>equivalent to what could be achieved by a high-resolution model\nusing a single frame of 4 m resolution imagery.</small>\n",
