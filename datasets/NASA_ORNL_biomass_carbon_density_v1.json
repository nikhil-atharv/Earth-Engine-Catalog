    "description": "This dataset provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and\nbelowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300-m spatial resolution. The\naboveground biomass map integrates land-cover specific, remotely sensed maps of woody,\ngrassland, cropland, and tundra biomass. Input maps were amassed from the published literature\nand, where necessary, updated to cover the focal extent or time period. The belowground biomass\nmap similarly integrates matching maps derived from each aboveground biomass map and land-cover\nspecific empirical models. Aboveground and belowground maps were then integrated separately\nusing ancillary maps of percent tree cover and landcover and a rule-based decision tree. Maps\nreporting the accumulated uncertainty of pixel-level estimates are also provided.\n\nProvider's note: The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring\nCentre (UNEP-WCMC) carbon biomass dataset\nrepresents conditions between 1982 and 2010 depending on land cover type. The relative patterns\nof carbon stocks are well represented with this dataset. The [NASA/ORNL carbon biomass dataset](https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/Global_Maps_C_Density_2010.html)\nrepresents biomass conditions for 2010, with uncertainty estimates at the pixel-level.\nAdditional biomass of non-dominant land cover types are represented within each pixel. For more\ndetailed information, please refer to the papers describing each dataset: [WCMC](WCMC_biomass_carbon_density_v1_0)\n[(Soto-Navarro et al. 2020)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0128)\nand NASA/ORNL [(Spawn et al. 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0444-4).\n",
