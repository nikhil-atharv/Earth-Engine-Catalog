    "description": "This dataset provides geospatial data for the total column dry air mole\nfraction of methane in the atmosphere, \"XCH4\", as observed by the MethaneAIR\nimaging spectrometer. XCH4 is defined as the total column amount (number of\nmolecules) of methane (\"CH4\") divided by the total amount of air (number of\nmolecules, water vapor amount removed) along the line of sight from the\nairborne spectrometer to the earth's surface and back up to the sun.\nAdditional data layers are provided for reference: observed albedo at 1622\nnm, surface pressure, and terrain height.\n\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80 times the warming power\nof carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. At\nleast 30% of today's global warming is driven by methane from human actions.\nCutting methane emissions associated with human activities - including avoidable\nemissions from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and waste management - is\nthe single fastest way to slow the rate of global warming.\n\nThe aircraft was flown at 11.5 - 13 km altitude (37,000 - 43,000 feet),\nacquiring 10 frames per second with a swath of 4.5 - 4.8 km with a 25 degree\nfield of view and 896 pixels across track, giving a native pixel size at\nnadir of approximately 25m along track and 5 m across track. The\nspectroscopic data are aggregated by 5 across track, giving a mean pixel\nsize of 25m x 25m. Concentrations (XCH4) are retrieved from these high\nresolution (0.1 nm sampling, 0.3nm resolution), spatially distributed\nspectra ([Chan Miller et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1962)),\nthen gridded on a 0.0001 x 0.0001 degree grid (approximately 10m x 8m over\nthe US). The precision of the gridded data is approximately 25 parts per\nbillion (1s, about 1.3%), and a spatial correlation length (1/e) of about\n70m. There are some variations from flight-to-flight according to operating\nconditions, look angle and surface albedo.\n\nThe flight pattern was typically a series of oval swaths in a Zamboni\npattern to cover a region, typically about 70 km x 100 km, over a 2 - 3 hour\ninterval. The data presented here are averaged where flight tracks overlap,\ntypically at the edges of each swath and in the urns at the top and bottom\nof the Zamboni pattern.\n\n\nThis dataset was generated using MethaneAIR measurements taken on flights\nbetween 30 July 2021 and 13 October 2023. MethaneAIR is an airborne precursor of\nthe MethaneSAT satellite mission, managed by [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/),\na wholly owned subsidiary of Environmental Defense Fund. Methane emission fluxes were produced using a geostatistical inverse\nmodeling framework on each of these Zamboni swaths.\n\n\nFor additional information about the MethaneAIR instrument, instrument\ncalibration and emission detections, please refer to recent publications by\n[Loughner et al.
