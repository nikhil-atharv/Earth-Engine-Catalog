    "description": "The EC JRC global map of forest cover provides a spatially explicit representation\nof forest presence and absence for the year 2020 at 10m spatial resolution.\n\nThe year 2020 corresponds to the cut-off date of the Regulation from the\nEuropean Union \"on the making available on the Union market and the export from\nthe Union of certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and\nforest degradation\" (EUDR, [Regulation (EU) 2023/1115](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R1115)). In the context of the\nEUDR, the global forest cover map can be used as a non-mandatory, non-exclusive,\nand not legally binding source of information. Further information about the\nmap and its use can be found on the [EU Observatory on Deforestation and Forest\nDegradation](https://forest-observatory.ec.europa.eu/forest/) (EUFO) in the section on Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nForest means land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5\nmeters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach those\nthresholds in situ, excluding land that is predominantly under agricultural or\nurban land use. Agricultural use means the use of land for the purpose of\nagriculture, including for agricultural plantations (i.e. tree stands in\nagricultural production systems such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm\nplantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems) and set- aside\nagricultural areas, and for rearing livestock. All plantations of relevant\ncommodities other than wood, that is cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber,\nsoya, are excluded from the forest definition.\n\nThe global map of forest cover was created by combining available global\ndatasets (wall-to-wall or global in their scope) on tree cover, tree height,\nland cover and land use into a single harmonized globally-consistent\nrepresentation of where forests existed in 2020.\n\nThe workflow consisted in first mapping the global maximum extent of tree\ncover circa the year 2020 from the combination of ESA World Cover 2020 and\n2021, WRI Tropical Tree Cover 2020, UMD Global land cover and land use 2019,\nGlobal Mangrove Watch 2020, and JRC Tropical Moist Forest 2020 datasets. In the\nsecond step, a series of overlays and decision rules were applied to reduce this\nmaximum extent of tree cover and align it with the Forest definition using\ndatasets covering cropland and commodity expansion (ESA World Cereal, UMD\nGlobal land cover and land use 2019, UMD Global Cropland Expansion,\nHigh-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial oil palm plantations,\nand WRI Spatial Database of Planted Trees), land use change (UMD global forest\ncover loss, JRC Tropical Moist Forest, IIASA Global Forest Management),\nbuilt-up (JRC Global Human Settlement), and water (JRC Global Surface Water).\n\nThe global input layers, mapping approach, and a preliminary accuracy\nassessment are described in a [JRC science for policy report](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f9baaa45-e73f-11ee-9ea8-01aa75ed71a1).\nThe JRC will undertake a formal statistically and thematically robust\naccuracy assessment in 2024.\n\nPlease also refer to the [list of known issues](https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/GFC) and to the [JRC Data Catalogue entry](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/10d1b337-b7d1-4938-a048-686c8185b290).\n",
