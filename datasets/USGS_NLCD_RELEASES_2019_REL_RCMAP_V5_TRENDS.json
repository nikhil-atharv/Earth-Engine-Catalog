    "description": "The RCMAP (Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection) \ndataset quantifies the percent cover of rangeland components across \nwestern North America using Landsat imagery from 1985-2023. The RCMAP \nproduct suite consists of ten fractional components: annual herbaceous, \nbare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous,\nsagebrush, shrub, tree, and shrub height in addition to the temporal \ntrends of each component. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP \nprocess relative to prior generations. First, high-resolution training \nwas revised using an improved neural-net classifier and modelling approach.\nThese data serve as foundation to the RCMAP approach. The training \ndatabase was further improved by incorporating additional datasets. Next, \nthe Landsat compositing approach was improved to better capture the range \nof conditions from across each year and through time. These composites are \nbased on Collection 2 Landsat data with improved geolocation accuracy and \ndynamic range. Finally, the Canadian portion of the sagebrush biome was \nincluded, which expanded the study area by 29,199 km2. \n\nProcessing efficiency has been increased using open-source software and \nUSGS High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The mapping area included \neight regions which were subsequently mosaicked. These data can be used to \nanswer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and \nthe suitability of management practices. Component products can be \ndownloaded at \n[Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium](https://www.mrlc.gov/data).\n\nThe temporal patterns were assessed in each RCMAP component with two \napproaches, 1) linear trends and 2) a breaks and stable states method \nwith an 8-year temporal moving window based on structural change at the \npixel level. Linear trend products include slope and p-value calculated \nfrom least squares linear regression. The slope represents the average \npercent cover change per year over the times-series and the p-value \nreflects the confidence of change in each pixel. The structural change \nmethod partitions the time-series into segments of similar slope values, \nwith statistically significant breakpoints indicating perturbations to the \nprior trajectory. The break point trends analysis suite relies on \nstructural break methods, resulting in the identification of the number \nand timing of breaks in the time-series, and the significance of each \nsegment. The following statistics were produced: 1) for each component, \neach year, the presence/absence of breaks, 2) the slope, p-value, and \nstandard error of the segment occurring in each year, 3) the overall \nmodel R2 (quality of model fit to the temporal profile), and 4) an index, \nTotal Change Intensity. This index reflects the total amount of change \noccurring across components in that pixel. The linear and structural \nchange methods generally agreed on patterns of change, but the latter \nfound breaks more often, with at least one break point in most pixels. \nThe structural change model provides more robust statistics on the \nsignificant minority of pixels with non-monotonic trends, while \ndetrending some interannual signal potentially superfluous from a \nlong-term perspective. \n",
