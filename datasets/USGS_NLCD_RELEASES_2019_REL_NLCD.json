A ninth epoch for 2021 is also available\n[here](USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2021_REL_NLCD). The images rely on the\nimperviousness data layer for the urban classes and on a decision-tree\nclassification for the rest.\n\nThis dataset has one image for the continental US for each epoch.\nAlaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico data can be found in the previous\n[2016 NLCD release](USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2016_REL).\n\nNLCD products are created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics\n(MRLC) Consortium, a partnership of federal agencies led by the\nU.S. Geological Survey.\n",
