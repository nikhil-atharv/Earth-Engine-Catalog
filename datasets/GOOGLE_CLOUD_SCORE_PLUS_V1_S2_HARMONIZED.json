    "description": "Cloud Score+ is a quality assessment (QA) processor for medium-to-high\nresolution optical satellite imagery. Cloud Score+ outputs do not explicitly\nprovide labels, e.g., \"cloud\" and \"cloud shadow\". Instead, QA artifacts are\ndefined on a continuous scale based on ground occlusion with respect to\nsolar radiation or the imaging sensor: if a ray incident to or reflected\nfrom a ground pixel is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere, the QA score\nis lower. Functionally, Cloud Score+ provides a holistic per-pixel\n\"usability\" score that can be thresholded to mask or even weight\nobservations used for downstream tasks such as time series analysis or\nclassification.\n\nThe Cloud Score+ S2_HARMONIZED dataset is being operationally produced in\nparallel with the [harmonized Sentinel-2 L1C collection](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_HARMONIZED).\nThis dataset includes two QA bands that grade the usability of\nindividual pixels with respect to surface visibility on a scale of [0, 1]\nwhere 0 represents \"not clear\" (occluded) while 1 represents \"clear\"\n(unoccluded) observations. The `cs` band scores QA based on a spectral\ndistance between the observed pixel and a (theoretical) clear reference\nobservation, while the `cs_cdf` band represents the likelihood an observed\npixel is clear based on an estimated cumulative distribution of scores for a\ngiven location through time.\n\nImages in the Cloud Score+ S2_HARMONIZED collection have the same id and\nsystem:index properties as the individual Sentinel-2 L1C assets from which\nthey were produced such that Cloud Score+ bands can be linked to source\nimages based on their shared system:index.\n\n",
