    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal\nagencies, has now developed and released seven National Land Cover\nDatabase (NLCD) products: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2019,\nand 2021. Beginning with the 2016 release, land cover products were\ncreated for two-to-three-year intervals between 2001 and the most\nrecent year. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable\ninformation on the Nation\u2019s land cover and land cover change.\nNLCD continues to provide innovative, consistent, and robust\nmethodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and\nland cover change database.\n\nThe NLCD 2021 release is update based, so the Land Cover and Impervious\nSurface products released in [2019](USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2019_REL_NLCD)\nare unchanged and used directly with NLCD 2021 for change analysis\nthough the NLCD timespan. Science products and the change index are\nupdated and will need to be reacquired to contain the additional 2021\nchange. These new products use a streamlined compositing process for\nassembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary\ndatasets; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover\nchange analysis strategy; a theme-based post-classification protocol for\ngenerating land cover and change products; a continuous fields\nbiophysical parameters modeling method; and a scripted operational system.\nThe overall accuracy of the 2019 Level I land cover was 91%. Results from\nthis study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly\nautomated procedure for NLCD 2021 operational mapping\n(see [doi:10.1080/15481603](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2181143)\nfor the latest accuracy assessment publication). Questions about the NLCD\n2021 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2021 land cover\nmapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or\nmrlc@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.\n\nPlease see National Land Cover Database (NLCD) [2019 NLCD release](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9KZCM54)\nfor the 2019 release of NLCD which is used with the 2021 release for\ncomparisons through the years.

This difference is expressed with two extra classes of\nland cover, called Shrub-Forest and Herbaceous-Forest which are\nrepresenting areas of current shrub and grass expected to transition\nback to a forest. Alternatively, the shrub and grass classes of\nShrub/Scrub and Grassland/Herbaceous will likely not transition to\na forest.

This product shows the most recent\nforest disturbance date between the years 1986-2021 for every year.\nThis product combines information from the NLCD 2021 change\ndetection, land cover classification, and the LANDFIRE Vegetation\nChange Tracker (VCT) disturbance product from 1984-2010. For NLCD\n2021, this product was used to assess where disturbance occurred for\nforest areas. This product was originally intended only for forest\nareas, but it also can be useful for other landcover classes.\nFor example, agricultural areas, which are typically disturbed\nyearly by tillage, are represented as being disturbed prior to 1986.\nThis \"prior to 86\" disturbance call was used in some instances as a\ndelineation between forested and non-forest areas. Other classes\nthat are not forest may also be represented with a disturbance\nindication if the area was forest at some time point during\n1986-2021. All images include the Science Products classification\nscheme follow the Land Cover system and are described in the\n[Product Legend](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description).\nThe legends are also available as metadata on each image. The classes\nin the product legend are given below.\n",
