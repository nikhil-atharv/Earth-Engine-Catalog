    "description": "**The area emissions model is still in development and not representative of\na final product.**\n\nThis dataset provides high-resolution, spatially disaggregated methane\nemission fluxes (kg/hr) of the Permian Delaware sub-basin in southern New\nMexico and western Texas as well as for the Uinta basin in Utah.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80 times the warming\npower of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the\natmosphere. At least 30% of today's global warming is driven by methane from\nhuman actions. Cutting methane emissions associated with human activities\n- including avoidable emissions from oil and gas operations, agriculture,\nand waste management - is the single fastest way to slow the rate of global\nwarming.\n\nThis dataset was generated using MethaneAIR measurements taken on 8 August\n2021 (research flight RF06) over the Permian and 11 August 2021 (RF08) over\nUinta. MethaneAIR is an airborne precursor of the MethaneSAT satellite\nmission, managed by [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/), a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Environmental Defense Fund. The methane emission fluxes\nwere produced using a geostatistical inverse modeling framework specialized\nto exploit the high spatial resolution, wide spatial coverage, and high\nprecision of MethaneAIR data.\n\nFor additional information about the MethaneAIR instrument, instrument\ncalibration and emission detections, please refer to recent publications\nby [Staebell et al.
