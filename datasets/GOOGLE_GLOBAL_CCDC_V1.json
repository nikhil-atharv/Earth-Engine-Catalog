    "description": "This collection contains precomputed results from running the\nContinuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm on\n20 years of Landsat surface reflectance data. CCDC is a break-point\nfinding algorithm that uses harmonic fitting with a dynamic RMSE\nthreshold to detect breakpoints in time-series data.\n\nThe dataset was created from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 Collection-1, Tier-1,\nsurface reflectance time series, using all daytime images between 1999-01-01\nand 2019-12-31. Each image was preprocessed to mask pixels identified as\ncloud, shadow, or snow (according to the 'pixel_qa' band), saturated pixels,\nand pixels with an atmospheric opacity > 300 (as identified by the\n'sr_atmos_opacity' and 'sr_aerosol' bands). Pixels repeated in\nnorth/south scene overlap were deduplicated. The results were\noutput in 2-degree tiles for all landmasses between -60&deg; and +85&deg; latitude.\nThe images are suitable to simply mosaic() into one global image.\n\nThe CCDC algorithm was run with the default algorithm parameters except for\nthe dateFormat:\n\n* tmaskBands: ['green', 'swir']\n* minObservations: 6\n* chiSquareProbability: 0.99\n* minNumOfYearsScaler: 1.33\n* dateFormat: 1 (fractional year)\n* lambda: 20\n* maxIterations: 25000\n\nEach pixel in the output is encoded using variable length arrays.  The outer\nlength of each array (axis 0) corresponds to the number of breakpoints\nfound at that location. The coefs bands contain 2-D arrays, where each inner\narray contains the scaling factors for the 8 terms in the linear harmonic\nmodel, in the order: [offset, t, cos(&omega;t), sin(&omega;t), cos(2&omega;t),\nsin(2&omega;t), cos(3&omega;t), sin(3&omega;t)], where &omega; = 2&Pi;.  The\nmodels are scale to produce refelectance units (0.0 - 1.0) for the optical\nbands and degrees (K) / 100.0 for the thermal band.\n\nNote that since the output bands are arrays and can only be downsampled\nusing a SAMPLE pyramiding policy. At lower zoom levels, the\nresults are usually no longer representative of the full-resolution data,\nand, for instance, tile boundaries can be seen due to the downsampled masks.\nIt's therefore not recommended to use this dataset at resolutions less than\n240m/pixel.\n\nThere are no current plans to add post-2019 assets to this dataset.\n",
