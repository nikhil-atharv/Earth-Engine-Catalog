    "description": "This dataset provides data for high-emitting methane point source detections\n(kg/hr) over 13 oil and gas or coal extraction areas from Colorado, New\nMexico, and Texas in the west to Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia in\nthe east, plus three urban areas (New York City, Phoenix, and Salt Lake\nCity).\n\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80 times the warming power\nof carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. At\nleast 30% of today's global warming is driven by methane from human actions.\nCutting methane emissions associated with human activities - including avoidable\nemissions from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and waste management - is\nthe single fastest way to slow the rate of global warming.\n\nArea emissions are estimated from observed XCH4 using a geostatistical inverse\nmodel framework (see [\"MethaneAIR L4 Area Sources\"](EDF_MethaneSAT_MethaneAIR_L4area) dataset). An atmospheric transport model - \nthe Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model, \"STILT\";\n[Lin et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003161),\n[Fasoli et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2813-2018); driven by\nmeteorological data from the NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model \"HRRR\" -\nis used to link variations in observed XCH4 to potential upwind sources. A\nhierarchical approach is used to separate XCH4 variations due to area emissions\nfrom those due to point source emissions or inflow across the domain boundary\n(the \"background\" concentration). Point source emissions are determined\nindividually (see [\"MethaneAIR L4 Point Sources\"](EDF_MethaneSAT_MethaneAIR_L4point) dataset) and pre-subtracted from the observed XCH4. An inverse model is then\nused to estimate XCH4 inflow across the boundary domain. Finally, area emissions\nare estimated using a geostatistical inverse model with an enforced non-negative solution. Total emissions are the sum of area and point source emissions.\n\nThis dataset was generated using MethaneAIR measurements taken on flights\nbetween 30 July 2021 and 13 October 2023. MethaneAIR is an airborne precursor of\nthe MethaneSAT satellite mission, managed by [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/),\na wholly owned subsidiary of Environmental Defense Fund. The methane emission fluxes were produced using a point source detection and\nemissions quantification framework specialized to exploit the high spatial\nresolution, wide spatial coverage, and high precision of MethaneAIR data\n(methodology is described in [Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023).)\nThe point source quantification framework was extensively tested in blind\ncontrolled-release experiments as detailed in [Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023)\nand [Abbadi et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02439). Not all\ndata products are available for all flights.\n\n\nFor additional information about the MethaneAIR instrument, instrument\ncalibration and emission detections, please refer to recent publications by\n[Loughner et al.
