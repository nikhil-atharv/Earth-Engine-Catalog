    "description": "These Landsat 5 TM composites are made from Level L1T orthorectified scenes, using the\ncomputed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.  See [Chander et al.\n(2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\nfor details on the TOA computation.\n\nAs of May 1, 2017, the USGS is no longer producing Pre-Collection Landsat, and therefore this collection is complete. Please switch to a Collection 1-based dataset. See [this documentation page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/landsat) for more information.\n\nThe Burn Area Index (BAI) is generated from the Red and\nNear-IR bands, and measures the spectral distance of each pixel from a\nreference spectral point (the measured reflectance of charcoal).  This\nindex is intended to emphasize the charcoal signal in post-fire\nimages. See\n[Chuvieco et al. (2002)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160210153129\nfor details.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach 32-day period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the 352nd day of the year.  The last composite of the\nyear, beginning on day 353, will overlap the first composite of the\nfollowing year by 20 days.  All the images from each 32-day period are\nincluded in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\n",
