    "description": "Rangeland ecosystems in the western United States have a dynamic response\nto climate change, fire, and other anthropogenic disturbances. The Rangeland\nCondition, Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (RCMAP) product aims to\ncapture this response by quantifying the percent cover of rangeland\ncomponents, associated error, and trends across the western U.S. using\nLandsat imagery from 1985-2020.\n\nRCMAP quantifies the percent cover of components across the western U.S.\nrangelands (after Rigge et al. 2020) using Landsat imagery from 1985-2020.\nThe RCMAP timeseries consists of eight fractional components: annual\nherbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial\nherbaceous, sagebrush and shrub, and the temporal trends of each. The four\nprimary components (bare ground, shrub, litter, and herbaceous) are designed\nto sum to 100% in each pixel when added to tree canopy cover. The secondary\ncomponents annual herbaceous and perennial herbaceous are subsets of the\nprimary component herbaceous, while non-sagebrush shrub and sagebrush are\nsubsets of shrub. Secondary components cannot have cover greater than their\nrespective primary component. One year, 2012, was excluded from\nthe timeseries due to a lack of quality imagery.\n\nMRLC developed an automated method to identify change in spectral\nconditions between each year in the Landsat archive and the circa 2016 base\nmap. Regression tree models were trained from the unchanged portions of each\nyear in the time series. Post-processing models corrected post-burn\ntrajectories and eliminated noise and illogical change in the predictions.\nThe current generation of RCMAP has been improved with more training data,\nregional-scale Landsat composites, and more robust change detection. MRLC\nassessed the temporal patterns in each component with a linear model and\nstructural change method which determines break points in the timeseries\nusing an 8-year temporal moving window. The linear and structural change\nmethods generally agreed on gross patterns of change, but the latter found\nbreaks more often with most pixels having at least one break point. Data\nprovide spatiotemporal information on the occurrence of breaks, but even\nmore critically, attribute those change events to specific component(s).\nThe spatially, temporally, and thematically (i.e., multi-component) detailed\nspecific information on rangeland condition can contribute to understanding\nmajor patterns of change at local, regional, and continental levels.\n\nSee also:\n\n* Rigge, M., C.
