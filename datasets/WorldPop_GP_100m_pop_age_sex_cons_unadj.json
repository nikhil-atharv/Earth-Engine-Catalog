    "description": "Global high-resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are\na prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population\ngrowth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop\nproject aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open\naccess population distribution datasets built using transparent and\npeer-reviewed approaches.\n\nFull details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the\ndata, along with open access publications, are provided on the\n[WorldPop website](https://www.worldpop.org/). In brief, recent census-based\npopulation counts matched to their associated administrative units are\ndisaggregated to ~100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches\nthat exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of\ngeospatial covariate layers. The mapping approach\nis Random Forest-based dasymetric redistribution.\n\nThis dataset contains top-down constrained breakdown of\nestimated population by age and gender groups. Currently only 2020 data\nare present.\n\nTop-down constrained age/sex structure estimate datasets for individual\ncountries for 2020 at 100m spatial resolution with country totals adjusted to\nmatch the corresponding official United Nations population estimates that have\nbeen prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat\n([2019 Revision of World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/EXCEL_FILES/1_Population/WPP2019_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.xlsx)).\n\n[See explanation of constrained vs unconstrained datasets](https://www.worldpop.org/methods/top_down_constrained_vs_unconstrained).\n\nFurther WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures,\npoverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on\nthe WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between\nresearchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de\nBruxelles, and University of Louisville. The project is principally funded by\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",
