    "description": "Aqueduct 4.0 is the latest iteration of WRI's water risk framework designed\nto translate complex hydrological data into intuitive indicators of water\nrelated risk. This dataset has curated 13 water risk indicators for\nquantity, quality and reputational concerns into a comprehensive framework.\nFor 5 of the 13 indicators, a global hydrological model called PCR-GLOBWB 2\nhas been used to generate novel datasets on sub-basic water supply.\nThe PCR-GLOBWB 2 model is also used to project future sub-basin water\nconditions using CMIP6 climate forcings. The projections center around\nthree periods (2030, 2050, and 2080) under three future scenarios\n(business-as-usual SSP 3 RCP 7.0, optimistic SSP 1 RCP 2.6, and\npessimistic SSP 5 RCP 8.5).\n\nThe water risk indicators have been aggregated by category (quantity,\nquality, reputational, and overall) into composite risk scores using\nsector-specific weighting schemes. In addition, select sub-basin scores have\nbeen aggregated into country and provincial administrative boundaries using\na weighted average approach, where sub-basins with more demand have a higher\ninfluence over the final administrative score.\n\nThe WRI Aqueduct future annual dataset provides future projections of water\nsupply, demand, stress, depletion, and variability based on CMIP6 climate\nprojections for 3 milestone years: 2030, 2050, and 2080. This dataset can be\nused to anticipate and adapt to future water challenges which will be useful\nfor water resource management, infrastructure development and climate change\nadaptation.\nThis [technical note](https://www.wri.org/research/aqueduct-40-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators)\nexplains in detail the framework, methodology, and data used\nin developing Aqueduct Floods.\n",
