    "description": "This dataset provides the locations of oil and gas (O&G) related\ninfrastructure globally.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping (OGIM) database is a project\ndeveloped by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/),\na wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF. The primary objective of developing\na standardized O&G infrastructure database such as OGIM is to support\nMethaneSAT's emission quantification, source characterization, and other\nscientific- or advocacy-relevant analyses of methane emissions from the oil\nand gas sector. The OGIM database is developed based on the acquisition,\nanalysis, and quality assurance of publicly available geospatial data\nsources of O&G facilities, which are combined within one standard data\nschema and coordinate reference system.\n\nThis dataset contains the spatial locations of the following types of\ninfrastructure assets:\n\n* oil and natural gas wells,\n* oil and gas pipelines,\n* natural gas compressor stations,\n* gathering and processing facilities,\n* tank batteries,\n* offshore platforms,\n* liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities,\n* crude oil refineries,\n* petroleum terminals,\n* injection and disposal facilities,\n* equipment and component locations,\n* satellite detections of oil and gas flares,\n* and \"other\" oil and gas related infrastructure, such as metering stations\n\n\nRecords in the OGIM are consolidated from numerous publicly-available\ngovernmental and academic sources. This list of sources is available [in the\nOGIM_v2.5.1_Data_Source_References.pdf](https://zenodo.org/records/13259749)\ndocument. For more information on each source, refer to the \"Data_Catalog\"\ntable that accompanies [Omara et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3761-2023).\n\nImportant notes about the attributes associated with these facility locations:\n\n- Missing values (i.e., values missing or not reported by the original data\nsource) are handled by assigning \"N/A\" to string attributes, -999 to\nnumerical attributes, and a generic date of \"1900-01-01\" to date/datetime\nattributes.\n\n- Facility operator names have not been altered in any way from the original\nsource of data and are assumed to be accurate as of the original source's\npublication date.\n\nFor more information about the OGIM database, including methods used in its\ndevelopment and key applications of the database, please refer to the recent\npublication by [Omara et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3761-2023).\n\nContact the data provider for more information about the project at this link:\n[https://www.methanesat.org/contact/](https://www.methanesat.org/contact/)\n\nThis dataset will be updated in-place with the new versions.\n",
