    "description": "The 2020 North American Land Cover 30-meter dataset was produced as part of\nthe North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral\neffort between Natural Resources Canada, the United States Geological\nSurvey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of\nStatistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia),\nNational Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comision\nNacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National\nForestry Commission of Mexico (Comision Nacional Forestal).  The\ncollaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental\nCooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico,\nand United States governments under the North American Agreement on\nEnvironmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the\nthree countries.\n\nThe general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a\nharmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high\naccuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North\nAmerican scale and which meets each country's specific requirements.\n\nThis 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover\ninformation for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous\nUnited States and 2021 over Alaska.  Each country developed its own\nclassification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an\ninput layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land\ncover products; see specific sections on data generation below.\n\nThe main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection\n2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and\nMexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands\nvaried among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements.  While\nCanada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and\n2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while\nAlaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The\nland cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between\n2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.\n\nIn order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North\nAmerica, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by\nCONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each\ncountry chose their own approaches, ancillary data, and land cover mapping\nmethodologies to create national datasets. This North America dataset was\nproduced by combining the national land cover datasets.  The integration of\nthe three national products merged four Land Cover map sections, Alaska,\nCanada, the conterminous United States and Mexico.\n\nSee also:\n\n* Natural Resources Canada has North American Land Cover information\n  available online at\n  [https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ee1580ab-a23d-4f86-a09b-79763677eb47](\n  https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ee1580ab-a23d-4f86-a09b-79763677eb47)\n\n* The National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity has\n  North American Land Cover information available online at\n  [https://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/monitoreo/cobertura-suelo](\n    https://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/monitoreo/cobertura-suelo)\n\n* The U.S. Geological Survey has North American Land Cover information\n  available online at [www.mrlc.gov](https://www.mrlc.gov)\n",
