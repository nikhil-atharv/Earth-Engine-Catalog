    "description": "'The RCMAP (Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection)\ndataset quantifies the percent cover of rangeland components across\nwestern North America using Landsat imagery from 1985-2023. The RCMAP\nproduct suite consists of ten fractional components: annual herbaceous,\nbare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous,\nsagebrush, shrub, tree, and shrub height in addition to the temporal\ntrends of each component. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP\nprocess relative to prior generations. First, high-resolution training\nwas revised using an improved neural-net classifier and modelling approach.\nThese data serve as foundation to the RCMAP approach. The training\ndatabase was further improved by incorporating additional datasets. Next,\nthe Landsat compositing approach was improved to better capture the range\nof conditions from across each year and through time. These composites are\nbased on Collection 2 Landsat data with improved geolocation accuracy and\ndynamic range. Finally, the Canadian portion of the sagebrush biome was\nincluded, which expanded the study area by 29,199 km2.\n\nProcessing efficiency has been increased using open-source software and\nUSGS High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The mapping area included\neight regions which were subsequently mosaicked. These data can be used to\nanswer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and\nthe suitability of management practices.
