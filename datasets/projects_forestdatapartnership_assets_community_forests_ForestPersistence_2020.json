    "description": "\n**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed.  Please see the GitHub \nREADME associated with this model for more information.**\n\nThis image provides a per-pixel score (in [0, 1]) that indicates whether \nthe pixel area is occupied by undisturbed forest in year 2020.\n\nThese scores are provided at 30 meter resolution, and have\nbeen generated by a convergence of evidence approach to combining multiple \nforest cover data sets into a level of continuous support for the presence \nof undisturbed forest, defined as naturally regenerating forest with \n\"no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological \nprocesses are not significantly disturbed\" or forests \"predominantly \ncomposed of trees established through natural regeneration.\"  The \nnumerical support, called ForestPersistence, is created from an ensemble of \nexisting datasets selected for their ability to describe forest \ndisturbance and management history, consistent with the definition.  \n\nThis community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data\nbecomes available from the community and the model used to produce the\nmaps continuously improves. To provide map-based feedback on this\ncollection, please see our\n[Collect Earth Online instance](https://app.collect.earth/collection?projectId=50778)\nand follow\n[these instructions](https://collect-earth-online-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/simplified.html).\n\nIf you would like to provide general feedback or additional datasets to\nimprove these layers, please reach out through\n[this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).\n\nFor more information about this dataset, see \n[the README](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/blob/main/models/forests/README.md) \non Google's Forest Data Partnership GitHub site. For more information about \nthe Forest Data Partnership, visit the \n[Forest Data Partnership website](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/).\n\n**Limitations**: Geographic scope is limited to +/- 80 degrees latitude \nand to calendar year 2020. Not all geographic regions are equally \nrepresented. For example, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and other \ncountries lack regionally specific datasets in the ensemble. Boreal forest \nmay not be well represented. This dataset is built from existing datasets, \nand any limitations and errors associated with those datasets may be \npresent. Landsat TimeLapse is a Google developed product that has not \nbeen used with LandTrendr previously. A probability sample of these types \nof forest cover coincident with the year 2020 is not available, making \naccuracy difficult to assess.\n\n\n",
