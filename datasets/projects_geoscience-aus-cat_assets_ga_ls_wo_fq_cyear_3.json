    "description": "Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Water Observations uses an algorithm to classify each pixel from Landsat satellite imagery as 'wet', 'dry', or 'invalid'. Water Observations Statistics provides information on how many times each year the Landsat satellites were able to clearly see an area, how many times those observations were wet, and what that means for the percentage of time that water was observed in the landscape.\n\nCombining the classified pixels into summaries covering each year gives the information on where water is usually, and where it is rarely. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the input water classifications, and can be difficult to interpret on its own. \n\nFor more information, please see the [DEA Water Observations Statistics Landsat](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/data-products/dea/686/dea-water-observations-statistics-landsat)\n\nThis product is part of the [Digital Earth Australia Program](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/)\n",
