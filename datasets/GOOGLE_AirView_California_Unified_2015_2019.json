    "description": "This large vector dataset contains high resolution air pollution mapping of\nNO, NO2, O3, CH4, CO2, BC, PN2.5, and UFP concentrations in California\nbetween June 2015 and June 2019.\n\nThe dataset consists of measurements collected using four Google Street View\nvehicles equipped with the Aclima mobile measurement and data integration\nplatform from 2015-05-28 to 2019-06-07.  Not all four cars were actively\nmapping over the entire time frame.  Note that there may be gaps in the data\nwhen an individual car was not mapping due to operational, mechanical, or\nsystem difficulties.\n\nDates of operation for each of the four cars:\n\n* Car A: 2016-05-03 - 2019-04-30\n* Car B: 2016-05-03 - 2018-06-08\n* Car C: 2015-05-28 - 2019-06-07\n* Car D: 2015-06-24 - 2018-11-05\n\nData was collected in several geographic regions of California including the\nSan Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and the northern San Joaquin Valley.\nMapping occurred in targeted neighborhoods or cities within these regions. \nThe data set contains a table titled \"California_Unified_2015_2019\" which\nconsists of the concentration of the pollutants Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide\n(NO2), Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Methane (CH4), Carbon Dioxide (CO2),\nBlack Carbon (BC), particle number less than 2.5 micrometers in size\n(PN2.5), and Ultrafine Particles (UFP)  measured using four Google Street\nView cars equipped with fast time-response, laboratory-grade instruments.\nThe data was collected at 1-Hz time resolution from 20150528 to 20190607 for\nroads in three regions of California - the San Francisco Bay area,\nLos Angeles, and the northern San Joaquin Valley.  Specific areas mapped\nvaried by region based on desired spatial data coverage and science\nquestions.  Each data point is geolocated with latitude and longitude as\nwell as the identity and speed of the car.\n\nFor details including methodologies, standards, data providers,\nmetadata field definitions and descriptions, refer to the\n[metadata](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1If15JccoJcN01Jg3ljN3V-qUFS0HywKAd4OsQ-_JXJo/view).\n",
