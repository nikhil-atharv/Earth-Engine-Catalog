    "description": "The global map of forest cover provides a spatially explicit representation\nof forest presence and absence for the year 2020 at 10m spatial resolution.\n\nThe year 2020 corresponds to the cut-off date of the Regulation from the\nEuropean Union \"on the making available on the Union market and the export\nfrom the Union of certain commodities and products associated with\ndeforestation and forest degradation\" (EUDR, Regulation (EU) 2023/1115).\nIn the context of the EUDR, the global forest cover map can be used as a\nnon-mandatory, non-exclusive and not legally binding source of information.\nFurther information about the map and its use can be found on the [EU\nObservatory on Deforestation and Forest Degradation](https://forest-observatory.ec.europa.eu/forest/) (EUFO) and namely in\nthe section on Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nForest means land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than\n5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach those\nthresholds in situ, excluding land that is predominantly under agricultural\nor urban land use. Agricultural use means the use of land for the purpose of\nagriculture, including for agricultural plantations (i.e. tree stands in\nagricultural production systems such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm\nplantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems) and set- aside\nagricultural areas, and for rearing livestock. All plantations of relevant\ncommodities other than wood, that is cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm,\nrubber, soya are excluded from the forest definition.\n\nThe global map of forest cover was created by combining existing global\nspatial layers (wall-to-wall or global in their scope), e.g. on land cover,\nland use, and tree height. The map aims to represent the state of forest\ncover by 31 December 2020. The global land cover from the ESA World Cover\nproject serves as one baseline layer to define the extent of tree cover for\nyear 2020 at 10 m spatial resolution. In 2024, the global map of forest\ncover 2020 was improved by integrating user feedback, and new or revised\nspatial data layers.\n\nIt now better captures temporally unstocked forests, low-density\ntropical forests, and secondary tropical forests that have regrown for at\nleast five years. Additionally, the exclusion criteria have been enhanced\nto more effectively exclude trees in urban areas, mining sites, wetlands,\nareas with shifting cultivation, and tree plantations. This is achieved by\nutilizing multiple global maps of canopy height, crop area, and specific\ncrop commodity maps to more accurately distinguish forests from trees\nunder agricultural use.\n\nFor direct access and metadata, please consult the JRC\ndata catalogue ([JRC 2024](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/e554d6fb-6340-45d5-9309-332337e5bc26)). A technical report ([Bourgoin et al 2024](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f9baaa45-e73f-11ee-9ea8-01aa75ed71a1/language-en))\ndescribes the mapping approach for the first version; a technical report for\nversion 2 is forthcoming. The global map of forest cover may be revised if\nnew information, additional large-scale data layers, or revised global\nspatial data layers will be made available for year 2020.\n\nFor a list of known issues please refer to [this website](https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/GFC)\n",
