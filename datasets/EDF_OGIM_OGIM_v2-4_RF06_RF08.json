    "description": "This dataset provides the locations of oil and gas (O&G) related\ninfrastructure within two key O&G producing regions in the United States:\nthe Delaware sub-basin of the Permian Basin in western Texas and southern\nNew Mexico, and the Uinta Basin in Utah.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping (OGIM) database is a project\ndeveloped by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/),\na wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF. The primary objective of developing\na standardized O&G infrastructure database such as OGIM is to support\nMethaneSAT's emission quantification, source characterization, and other\nscientific- or advocacy-relevant analyses of methane emissions from the oil\nand gas sector. The OGIM database is developed based on the acquisition,\nanalysis, and quality assurance of publicly available geospatial data\nsources of O&G facilities, which are combined within one standard data\nschema and coordinate reference system.\n\nThis dataset contains the spatial locations of the following types of\ninfrastructure assets:\n\n* oil and gas wells,\n* natural gas compressor stations,\n* gathering and processing facilities,\n* petroleum terminals,\n* oil and gas pipelines,\n* satellite detections of oil and gas flares,\n* and \"other\" oil and gas related infrastructure, such as metering stations.\n\nRecords in the OGIM are consolidated from numerous publicly-available\ngovernmental and academic sources, including:\n\n* [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)](https://hifld-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/pages/hifld-open)\n* [EPA Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool (FLIGHT)](https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do)\n* [Texas Railroad Commission (RRC)](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/resource-center/research/data-sets-available-for-download/)\n* [New Mexico Energy Minerals, and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD)](https://ocd-hub-nm-emnrd.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd971b8e25c54d1a8ab7c549244cf3cc_0/about)\n* [Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC)](https://gis.utah.gov/data/energy/oil-gas/)\n* [Earth Observation Group (EOG) at the Colorado School of Mines](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnf/global_gas_flare.html)\n* [Marchese et al, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b02275)\n\nThe O&G facilities in this dataset are spatially coincident with the extent\nof MethaneAIR measurements taken on 8 August 2021 (research flight RF06)\nover the Permian Basin and 11 August 2021 (research flight RF08) over the\nUinta Basin. MethaneAIR is an airborne precursor of the MethaneSAT satellite\nmission, managed by MethaneSAT LLC. Only O&G facilities found within the RF06\nor RF08 region of interest are included in this data release.\n\nImportant notes about the attributes associated with these facility locations:\n\n- Missing values (i.e., values missing or not reported by the original data\nsource) are handled by assigning \"N/A\" to string attributes, -999 to\nnumerical attributes, and a generic date of \"1900-01-01\" to date/datetime\nattributes.\n\n- Facility operator names have not been altered in any way from the original\nsource of data and are assumed to be accurate as of the original source's\npublication date.\n\nFor more information about the OGIM database, including methods used in its\ndevelopment and key applications of the database, please refer to the recent\npublication by [Omara et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3761-2023).\n\nContact the data provider for more information about the project at this link:\n[https://www.methanesat.org/contact/](https://www.methanesat.org/contact/)\n",
