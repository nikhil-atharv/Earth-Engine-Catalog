    "description": "The RCMAP (Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection) dataset\nquantifies the percent cover of rangeland components across the western\nU.S. using Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2021. The RCMAP product suite\nconsists of nine fractional components: annual herbaceous, bare ground,\nherbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous, sagebrush,\nshrub, and tree, in addition to the temporal trends of each\ncomponent. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP process relative to\nprior generations. First, they have trained time-series predictions directly\nfrom 331 high-resolution sites collected from 2013 to 2018 from Assessment,\nInventory, and Monitoring (AIM) instead of using the 2016 \"base\" map as an\nintermediary. This removes one level of model error and allows the direct\nassociation of high-resolution derived training data to the corresponding\nyear of Landsat imagery. They have incorporated all available (as of\n10/1/22) Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Assessment, Inventory, and\nMonitoring (AIM), and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF)\nobservations. LANDFIRE public reference database training observations\nspanning from 1985 to 2015 have been added. Neural network models with Keras\ntuner optimization have replaced Cubist models as the classifier. They have\nadded a tree canopy cover component.  The study area has expanded to include\nall of California, Oregon, and Washington; in prior generations, landscapes\nto the west of the Cascades were excluded. Additional spectral indices have\nbeen added as predictor variables, tasseled cap wetness, brightness, and\ngreenness. Geographic location and elevation above sea level have been added\nas predictor variables. CCDC-Synthetic Landsat images were obtained for 6\nmonthly periods for each region and were added as predictors. These data\naugment the phenologic detail of the 2 seasonal Landsat composites.\n\nPost-processing has been improved with updated fire recovery equations\nstratified by ecosystem resistance and resilience (R and R) classes (Maestas\nand Campbell, 2016) to stratify recovery rates. Ecosystem R and R maps are\nonly available for the sagebrush biome.  They intersected classes with 1985\nto 2020 average water year precipitation to identify precipitation\nthresholds corresponding to R and R classes. Outside of the sagebrush biome,\nprecipitation was used to produce R and R equivalent (low, medium,\nhigh). Due to the fast recovery following fire in California chaparral\n(e.g., Keeley and Keeley, 1981, Storey et al., 2016), they used EPA level 3\necoregions to define a 4th R and R zone. Recovery rates are based on (Arkle\net al., (in press)) who evaluated the recovery of plant functional groups in\n1,278 post-fire rehab plots by time since disturbance stratified by\necosystem resistance and resilience. They have expanded this analysis by\nevaluated postfire-recovery in all AIM and LMF data across the West to\nestablish maximum sage, shrub, and tree cover by time-since fire. Recovery\nlimits in California follow (Keeley and Keeley, 1981 and Storey et al.,\n2016). Second, post-processing has been enhanced through a revised noise\ndetection model. For each pixel, they fit a third order polynomial model for\neach component cover time-series. Observations with a z-score more than 2\nstandard deviations from the mean are removed, and a new third order\npolynomial model (i.e., cleaned fit) is fit to observations within this\nthreshold. Finally, looking again at all observations, those observations\nwith a z-score more than 2 standard deviations from the mean of the cleaned\nfit are replaced with the mean of the prior and subsequent year component\ncover values.\n\nThe mapping area included eight regions which were subsequently mosaicked\nfor all nine components.  These data can be used to answer critical\nquestions regarding the influence of climate change and the suitability of\nmanagement practices.
