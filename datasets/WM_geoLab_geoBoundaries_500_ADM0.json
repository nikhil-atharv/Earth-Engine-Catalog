    "description": "The geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries\nDatabase is an online, open license resource of boundaries (i.e., state,\ncounty) for every country in the world. Currently 199 total entities are\ntracked, including all 195 UN member states, Greenland, Taiwan, Niue, and\nKosovo. They provide three different type of datasets, the one currently\ningested is Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones.\n\nComprehensive Global Administrative Zones (CGAZ) is a set of global\ncomposites for administrative boundaries. Disputed areas are removed and\nreplaced with polygons following US Department of State definitions. It has\nthree boundary levels ADM0, ADM1 and ADM2, clipped to international\nboundaries (US Department of State), with gaps filled between borders.\nADM0 is part of CGAZ and it has country-level boundaries.\n\n(see [Dataset description of WM global administation boundaries](\n  https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html).\n",
